# Hi, I'm Kenneth 👋

I'm a **Chevening Scholar** currently pursuing an **MSc in Applied Social Data Science** at the **London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)**. My work sits at the intersection of data science, development economics, and science & technology policy, with a focus on how innovation systems can drive inclusive growth in developing countries.

Back home in the Philippines, I co-pioneered the award-winning **GRIND (Grassroots Innovation for Inclusive Development) Program**: a community-led initiative that documents and scales traditional knowledge practices across conflict-affected communities in Mindanao.

## 🔬 Research

### LSE Proposed Dissertation: 
Examining **regional R&D inequality in the Philippines** using DOST survey data, applying machine learning and spatial analysis to understand how geographic fragmentation shapes innovation systems in archipelagic developing economies.

### 📄 Publications
I have **8 peer-reviewed publications** spanning innovation systems, regional development, and traditional knowledge documentation. Selected themes include:

- Grassroots innovation and inclusive development in conflict-sensitive contexts
- Traditional knowledge practices in Mindanao's indigenous and Moro communities
- Science, technology, and innovation policy in the Philippines
- Regional innovation system mapping for archipelagic developing economies
